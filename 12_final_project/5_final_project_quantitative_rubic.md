Final Project Scoring Guidelines
------

The instructor will fill this rubric out as completely as possible during your presentation. After your presentation, you'll get a chance to look at the partially filled-out rubric and can ask a questions. The instructor will finish filling out this rubric when scoring the out-of-class portion. The instructor reserves the right to modify the scores on any section, in other words what you see after your presentation is just an estimate of your final score). The instructor will post the completed rubric to Canvas.

See Final Project Instructions for the respective due dates for each element.
