"Applications of reinforcement learning are still far from routine and typically require as much art as science. Making applications easier and more straightforward is one of the goals of current research in reinforcement learning."  
— Sutton & Bart

It might appear difficult to find an appropriate project for Reinforcement Learning, it is an under-developed field relative to traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or Natural Language Processing. You should think of it as more open because fewer things have been done. 

This project requires using your imagination paired with your Data Science acumen. You must find a new problem to solve which requires creatively. That creatively has to be bounded by what is possible within the timeline of the course, access to compute, and your skills.

RL projects in a nutshell - Take a problem, make it sequential, define the environment, define the agent, and define the rewards. Then you can find and apply RL algorithms.

Just to be clear, you do not have to "solve" a problem. Your task is to write new code that performs better than chance.

General ideas
------

- Be inspired by Chapter 16 of _Reinforcement Learning_ by Sutton and Barto.
- [OpenAI hackathon ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pmqV-dAFSRDVYct9m6smP702f9cUIsPYTyamPLUcQZs/edit#).
- Solve an established problem on a new platform. For example, port an OpenAI solution to Ray.
- Take a existing game, feel free to simplify or extend the rules.
- Make up a simple game and simulate it.  
- Extend an existing application, for example [Awesome RL applications](https://github.com/aikorea/awesome-rl#applications)
- Rewrite unsolved computer science challenges as RL problems, for example [BFS for Snakebird](https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2018-07-23-optimizing-breadth-first-search/)
- Enter [AWS's DeepRacer Game](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/)
- Enter [RL competition](http://www.rl-competition.org/) 
- Enter [AI crowd challenges](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/)
- Implement a research paper. Find a paper without Python code and write Python code for it.
- Demonstrate how hyperparameters can influence bias-variance trade-offs in specific dataset.
- Transfer learning. Agents trained on one task can more quickly learn another task.
- Multi-agent problems and algorithms. We are not cover it in class. 
    + Enter [MalmO Competition](https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/marlo-2018)
- Other RL algorithms not covered in class.
- Music! Music is a sequential activity with rewards. Imagine different agents "jamming" together and with humans.
- Your own idea. This is your project. What is interesting to you?

Helpful Advice
-----

- [Stanford's version of this project](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/project.html)
- [Lessons Learned Reproducing a Deep Reinforcement Learning Paper](http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl)
- Topics that are suggested to be avoided:
    + Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The course does not adequately prepare you for DRL. Typically, DRL takes orders of magnitude longer to train. You are interested in DRL. You must speak with Brian ASAP.
    + Physical projects. It much faster to train a digital simulation. A robotic project will probably take longer than you have time for.
    - "Hard" problems that require distributed computing.
    - Theoretical work. This is an applied project.
    - Games where changing the rules is a move (e.g., [Nomic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic))
