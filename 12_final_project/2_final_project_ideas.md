Final Projects Ideas
======

I know that it might appear difficult to find the appropriate projects for Reinforcement Learning, it is under developed relative to traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or Natural Language Processing. You should think of it as open because less things have been done. 

Take a problem, make it sequential, define the environment, define the agent, and define the rewards. Then you can find and apply RL algorithms.

Just to be clear, you do not have solve a problem. You just write new working code that performs better than chance.

General ideas
------

- [OpenAI hackathon ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pmqV-dAFSRDVYct9m6smP702f9cUIsPYTyamPLUcQZs/edit#)
- Solve an established problem in a new platform. For example, port an OpenAI solution to Ray.
- Take a existing game, feel free to simplify or extend the rules.
- Make a up simple game and simulate it.  
- Implement a research paper. Find a paper without Python code and write Python code for it.
