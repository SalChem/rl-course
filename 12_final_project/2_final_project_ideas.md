Final Projects Ideas
======

It might appear difficult to find an appropriate project for Reinforcement Learning, it is an under-developed field relative to traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or Natural Language Processing. You should think of it as more open because fewer things have been done. 

This project requires using your imagination paired with your Data Science acumen. You must find a new problem to solve which requires creatively. That creatively has to be bounded by what is possible within the timeline of the course, access to compute, and your skills.

RL projects in a nutshell - Take a problem, make it sequential, define the environment, define the agent, and define the rewards. Then you can find and apply RL algorithms.

Just to be clear, you do not have to "solve" a problem. Your task is to write new code that performs better than chance.

General ideas
------

- [OpenAI hackathon ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pmqV-dAFSRDVYct9m6smP702f9cUIsPYTyamPLUcQZs/edit#)
- Solve an established problem on a new platform. For example, port an OpenAI solution to Ray.
- Take a existing game, feel free to simplify or extend the rules.
- Make up a simple game and simulate it.  
- Implement a research paper. Find a paper without Python code and write Python code for it.
- Multi-agent problems and algorithms. We are not cover it in class. 
- Other RL algorithms not covered in class.
- Music! Music is a sequential activity with rewards. Imagine different agents "jamming" together and with humans.
- Your own idea. This is your project. What is interesting to you?

Helpful Advice
-----

- [Stanford's version of this project](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/project.html)
- [Lessons Learned Reproducing a Deep Reinforcement Learning Paper](http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl)
- Avoid:
    -  "Hard" problems that require distributed computing.
    - Theortical work. This is an applied project.
    - Games where changing the rules is a move like [Nomic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic)
