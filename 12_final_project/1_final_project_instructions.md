Reinforcement Learning Final Project
=====
 
Purpose: Implement Reinforcement Learning algorithm(s) to solve a problem

Learning Outcomes:
----

- Formulate a meaningful and answerable Reinforcement Learning applied research question.
- Implement Reinforcement Learning algorithm(s). 
- The implemented algorithms should learn from the data.
- Communicate your process and findings to a technical audience.
- Write working and well-organized code.

Instructions
----

This is your project so it is up to you to develop the right applied research question. The instructor will approve the research question to make sure it is appropriate and within scope. Acquiring data should not take away from the other aspects of the project (i.e., no collecting or web scraping the data). You can use "toy" data or synthetic data.

This project can either be individual or teams of two people.

This project will become a part of your public Data Science portfolio, thus all data must be public and code must be public with an appropriate license.  

It is best if all ideas and code are original with you. However, you can build on previous work. If you choose to incorporate previous work, the project will be more challenging because you'll have to be very clear what was previously done and what your unique contribution is. You must cite all ideas and code immediately adjacent (i.e., comments or markdown cell with hyperlinks). See course materials for examples. __Failure to cite any ideas and code, will result in an automatic O on this project.__

You'll communicating your findings to a technical audience. You'll give an individual presentation during the last day of class on 2018-06-27.  The presentation will be short (5-7 minutes) with a period of questions and (hopefully) answers. 

You'll also turn in a summary report. The expected form for the summary report is a Jupyter Notebook. The summary report and in-class presentation can be the same if you present the Jupyter Notebook as slides with the RISE package. If you choose to present your summary report as the in-class presentation, please "skip" unimportant details when presenting. See course notebooks as examples of combing visual presentation, technical details, and references.

Final Project Scoring Guidelines
------

The instructor will fill Presentation Rubric out as completely as possible during your presentation. After your presentation, you'll get a chance to look at the Presentation Rubric and can ask a questions. The instructor reserves the right to modify the scores on any section, in other words what you see after your presentation is just an estimate of your final score).

The instructor will finish filling out the other rubrics when scoring the out-of-class portion.  The instructor will post all completed rubrics to Canvas.

For ideas to improve your presentation, summary, and code:

- See MSDS's Business Communication course [here](https://github.com/brianspiering/business-communication).
- The summary is __not__ a formal technical report but will contain the elements. An overall is [here](https://www.aresearchguide.com/writing-a-technical-report.html).
- ["A Philosophy of Software Design"](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201) is a must-read to improve code quality.

Final Project Tips:
----

- Make it run, make it right, make it fast. (in that order)
- Go end-to-end as quickly possible, then explore options for each stage:
    1. Define problem 
    2. Create environment 
    3. Implement simple algorithm 
    4. Examine empirical evidence of learning. 
- Your project has to show evidence of learning, meaning the algorithm performs above chance. In order to get a high grade, you do __not__ need to completely solve the problem or find the provably optimal policy. The goal is to create working code to better under a specific problem with Reinforcement Learning.
- How do I get a "A"? 
    - Do something groundbreaking (seriously). Either ground-breaking for the field or for the class.
    - Fit models and use methodology from outside class materials.
