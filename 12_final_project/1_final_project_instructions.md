Reinforcement Learning Final Project
=====
 
Purpose: Implement Reinforcement Learning algorithm(s) to solve a problem


Learning Outcomes:
----

- Formulate a meaningful and answerable Reinforcement Learning applied research question.
- Implement Reinforcement Learning algorithm(s). 
- The implemented algorithms should learn from the data.
- Communicate your process and findings to a technical audience.
- Write working and well-organized code.

Instructions
----

This project will become a part of your public Data Science portfolio, thus all data must be public and code must be public with an appropriate license.  

It is best if all ideas and code are original with you. However, you can build on previous work. If you choose to incorporate previous work, the project will be more challenging because you'll have to be very clear what the previous was and what your unique contribution is.

You must cite all ideas and code immediately adjacent (i.e., comments or markdown cell with hyperlinks). See course materials for examples. __Failure to cite any ideas and code, will result in an automatic O on this project.__

This is your project so it is up to you to develop the right applied research question. The instructor will approve the research question to make sure it is appropriate and within scope. Acquiring data should not take away from the other aspects of the project (i.e., no collecting or web scraping the data). You can use "toy" data or synthetic data.

You'll communicating your findings to a technical audience. You'll give an individual presentation during the last day of class on 2018-06-27 and submit a link to your GitHub repo on Canvas. 

The presentation will be 7 minutes with 1 minutes of questions and (hopefully) answers. The presentation and organization of your repo and code style will be scored. 

Signup: TBD  

###  Hints

- Make it run, make it right, make it fast. (in that order)
- Go end-to-end as quickly possible, data -> simple algorithm -> evidence of learning. Then explore options for each stage.
- How do I get a "A"? 
    - Do something groundbreaking (seriously). Either ground-breaking for the field or for the class.
    - Fit models and use methodology from outside class materials.
