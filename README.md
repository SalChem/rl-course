Course Description
----

This course will cover techniques in applied Reinforcement Learning (RL). Reinforcement Learning is one the most successful subdomains within Artificial Intelligence (AI). The course will focus on contemporary, practical applications, such as search strategies and deep reinforcement learning to solve games. 

This course is part of the [MS in Data Science program at the University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science).

Prerequisite Knowledge
----

- Working knowledge of probability, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning
- Intermediate level of Python (e.g., ability to create to classes).

Learning Outcomes
----

By the end of the course, you should be able to:  

1. Define Artificial Intelligence (AI) and identify applications and limitations.
1. Implement common search techniques, such as beam search and Bayesian Optimization.
1. Implement common Reinforcement Learning techniques, such as multi-arm bandits and q-learning.
1. Use Reinforcement Learning techniques to solve applied problems.

Grading

| Item           | Weight   |
|:---------------|:--------:|
| Participation  | 10%      |
| Exam           | 30%      |
| Labs           | 30%      |
| Final Project  | 30%      |
| __Total__      | __100%__ |

Each item's contribution is capped its percentage. The total course percentage is capped at 100%.

Currently, there is no extra credit. If there is any extra credit, it entirely at the discretion of the instructor.

We'll be using Canvas as the learning management system (LMS), aka gradebook. The instructional team will do their best to have Canvas accurately reflect your current scores in the course. However, Canvas may not 100% accurate all the time. In other words, your actual grade maybe significant different than it appears on Canvas. 

### Participation

I try to create an active learning environment in my classroom, which is incentivized with the _Participation_ grade. Attendance is mandatory, you can't participate if you don't attend. It is the responsibility of the student to attend all classes. If you have to miss class, due to sickness or other circumstances, please notify your instructor by Slack in advance. Supporting documents (e.g., doctor’s notes) should accompany absences due to sickness.

Tardiness negatively impacts an active learning environment, thus will impact your participation grade.

You must show up to each session prepared. Each person is important to the dynamic of the class, and therefore students are required to participate in class activities. Expect to be "cold called". I call on students at random not to put you on the spot but to keep you engaged in the material at all times.

### Exam

There will be one exam. It will be a combination of multiple choice, short answer, and programming questions.

### Labs

The labs will be hands-on activities. The coding sections will be implementing algorithms from scratch or applying common libraries (e.g., PyTorch).

Late assignments will only be accepted for medical emergencies.

### Final Project 

In lieu of a Final Exam, there will be a Final Project. Details in Final Project Folder.

Grading standards
----

The MSDS program considers a grade of "A" to represent exceptional work with respect to both the instructor's expectations and peer student achievements. I consider an "A" grade to be above and beyond what most students achieve. A grade of "B" represents the expected outcome, what is called "competence" in a business setting. A "C" grade represents achievements lower than the instructor's expectations for competence in the subject. A grade of "F" represents little or no work in the course.

Students with disabilities
-----

If you are a student with a disability or disabling condition, or if you think you may have a disability, please contact [USF Student Disability Services](https://myusf.usfca.edu/sds) (SDS) for information about accommodations.

Behavioral Expectations
----

All students are expected to behave in accordance with the [Student Conduct Code](https://myusf.usfca.edu/fogcutter) and other University policies.

Academic Integrity
-----

USF upholds the standards of honesty and integrity from all members of the academic community. All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's [Honor Code](https://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/).

You may not copy code from other current or previous students. All suspicious activity will be investigated and, if warranted, passed to the Dean of Sciences for action.  Copying answers or code from other students or sources during a quiz, exam, or for a project is a violation of the university’s honor code and will be treated as such. Plagiarism consists of copying material from any source and passing off that material as your own original work. Plagiarism is plagiarism: it does not matter if the source being copied is on the Internet, from a book or textbook, or from quizzes or problem sets written up by other students. Giving code or showing code to another student is also considered a violation. You must also abide by the copyright laws of the United States.

The golden rule: **You must never represent another person’s work as your own.** Credit to [Terence Parr](https://github.com/parrt/msds689).

If you ever have questions about what constitutes plagiarism, cheating, or academic dishonesty in my course, please feel free to ask me.

Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)
-----

CAPS provides confidential, free [counseling](https://myusf.usfca.edu/student-health-safety/caps) to student members of our community.

Confidentiality, Mandatory Reporting, and Sexual Assault
-------

For information and resources regarding sexual misconduct or assault visit the [Title IX](https://myusf.usfca.edu/TITLE-IX) coordinator or USF's [Callisto website](http://usfca.callistocampus.org/).
