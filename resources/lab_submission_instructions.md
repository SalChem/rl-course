Lab Submission Instructions
------

1. Rename notebook with your __login id appended to beginning__: `lab_1_tower_of_hanoi.ipynb` -> `bspiering_lab_1_tower_of_hanoi.ipynb`
1. Write code until unit tests pass (or you give up).
1. Submit completed lab to Canvas before due date.

Here are __invalid__ renaming examples:

- Brian_Spiering_regression_models_lab.ipynb
- Brian_Spiering.ipynb
- bspiering.ipynb

If the submitted file is not renamed in the right format, it would be considered as no submission and will result in a zero grade.

Do not add extra cells. Adding any additional cells will result in a zero grade.

You might have the phenomena of "it works on my computer" but still lose points. Even though if the code passed all the tests on your computer, the code could still be __not__ correct. 

There is a common logical fallacy with testing code: A failing test means there is guaranteed to be a problem. A passing test does not guarantee there is no problem.

I do my best to create a representative test suit, but tests are no guarantee of complete correctness. Remember - it is impossible to fully test any computer program http://www.testingeducation.org/BBST/foundations/Kaner_impossibility.pdf

The test are there to assist you and me, not replace thinking for you or me.
